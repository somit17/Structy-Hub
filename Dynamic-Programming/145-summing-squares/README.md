## summing squares

Write a function, *summing_squares*, that takes a target number as an argument. The function should
return the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to the target. A perfect square is a number of the
form (i*i) where i >= 1.

For example: 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares, but 8 is not perfect square.

```plaintext
Given 12:

summing_squares(12) -> 3

The minimum squares required for 12 is three, by doing 4 + 4 + 4.

Another way to make 12 is 9 + 1 + 1 + 1, but that requires four perfect squares.
